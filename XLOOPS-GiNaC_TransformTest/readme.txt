1./ build all the neccessary files by executing build_xloops_ginac.sh
2./ review build_vegas_cod.sh, if you can make the proccess work, please run it.


3./ THE INTEGRAND code is in the files: D0Integrand.cpp and D0Integrand.h. I have just implemented equation 1 for example.
4./ You can review all the code. But for quick, you can review:
	D0Integrand.*,
	dataplot_4dhead,
	dataplot_4dtail,
	build_xloops_ginac.sh,
	build_vegas_code.sh



for a quick reference:
all generated code will go to generatedcode folder
all data file (to plot) should go to plotdata folder
all vegas executing result should go to vegasresult folder
