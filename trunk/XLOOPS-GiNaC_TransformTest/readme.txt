1./ build all the neccessary files by executing build_xloops_ginac.sh
2./ review and run the script build_vegas_code.sh to execute the whole thing

3./ THE INTEGRAND code is in the files: D0Integrand.cpp and D0Integrand.h.
4./ You can review all the code. But for quick, you can review:
	D0Integrand.*,
	dataplot_4dhead,
	dataplot_4dtail,
	build_xloops_ginac.sh,
	build_vegas_code.sh



for a quick reference:
all generated code will go to generatedcode folder
all executable code will go to exec folder
all data file (to plot) should go to plotdata folder
all vegas executing result should go to vegasresult folder
