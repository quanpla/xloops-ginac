#summary Mapping between codes & analytic docs Variables:

= Introduction =

I need to use some cryptic name for code variables and functions for the sake of duplicate naming.
In general, when the variable have indexes, its corresponding variable in the code will be a matrix of [http://www.ginac.de/reference/ex_8h-source.html ex] with the name of prefix *mat`_`*. Example would help:
 F,,nmlk,,  <=>  `mat_F[n][m][l][k]`, and often have a function to calculate its value `ex fn_F(int n, int m, int n, int k)`
